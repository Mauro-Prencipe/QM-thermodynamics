# Input file 
# Enter (in any order; blank lines or commented lines ignored):
#
# STATIC:  file of the E(V) static energy curve   
# VOLUME:  file with the set of volumes for which the frequencies were calculated
# FREQ:    file with the sets of frequencies (one set for each volume)
# EXCLUDE: modes to be excluded from the the calculation of free energy
# EXP:	   file with experimental data
# FITVOL:  fitting of the frequencies by means of a polynomial function
# FU:      number of formula units in the (primitive) cell
# SET:     set of volumes to be used in the calculation (list of integers)
#          ** Note ** for spline interpolation, volumes must be
#          in ascent order
# TEMP:    temperature list (for EoSFit)
# INI:     initial parameters for the EoS 
# CP       powers for the polynomial fit of Cp(T)
# ALPHA:   Powers for the polynomial fit of alpha(T) (fixed pressure)
